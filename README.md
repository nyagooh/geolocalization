# Groupie Tracker - Search Bar

## Project Description
The Groupie Tracker Search Bar project focuses on creating a functional search feature for a web application. This feature enables clients to search through data for specific attributes, such as artists, members, or other relevant information, and return results in an intuitive and user-friendly manner.

### Key Features
1. **Search Cases**:
    - Artist/Band Name
    - Members
    - Locations
    - First Album Date
    - Creation Date

2. **Case-Insensitive Search**:
    - The search functionality is designed to be case-insensitive, ensuring flexibility for users.

3. **Typing Suggestions**:
    - As the user types, suggestions are displayed dynamically.
    - Suggestions identify and indicate the type of the result (e.g., member, artist/band).

4. **Example Behavior**:
    - Typing "phil" might suggest:
      - "Phil Collins - Member"
      - "Phil Collins - Artist/Band"

### Technology and Approach
- The application leverages efficient algorithms to provide real-time search suggestions.
- The UI focuses on responsiveness and clarity to ensure an excellent user experience.
